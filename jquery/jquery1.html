                    Graphic Design and Web Design may seem like they are basically the same job.
                      However, there are a few key differences between what a Graphic Designer does
                      and what a Web Designer does. These differences are important both for those 
                      looking to hire a designer as well as those looking to start a career as one.
                      Let's take a look at what each type of work entails.

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
                that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
            </div>
            <div class="tab-content tab_3">
                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
                have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words 
                which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
                Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
                middle of text.
